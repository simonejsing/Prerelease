Developer: Welcome! This is a story about a developer building a game from scratch, and his struggles to get the game to work just right!
It is prerelease software in the purest sense, and you should expect lots of glitches, bugs and otherwise awkward moments in this game.
===
You: Bugs?
===
Developer: Did I say bugs? I meant unintended features of course...

Nevertheless, I hope you will enjoy playing through this game.

If not.... NO REFUNDS!
===
You: Why am I a chicken?
===
Developer: Erh.. I have no idea. After all, I'm just the developer, you know I code and stuff..
You should take it up with the designer...
===
Designer: Yeah.. that was the first thing I found, you know, mock graphics and all.
===
You: I'm not sure I understand?
===
Designer: That's what we put in place of the real graphics so the developer has something to work with, without having to wait for the final graphics
===
You: But this is the final game!?
===
Developer: As we said.. NO REFUNDS!
