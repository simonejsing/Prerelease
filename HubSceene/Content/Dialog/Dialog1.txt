This is a story about a developer building a game from scratch, and his struggles to get the game to work just right!
It is prerelease software in the purest sense, and you should expect lots of glitches, bugs and otherwise awkward moments in this game.
===
Did I say bugs? I meant unintended features of course...
===
Nevertheless, I hope you will enjoy playing through this game.

If not.... NO REFUNDS!
